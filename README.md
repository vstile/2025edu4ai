## üîç Description

We provide code and preprocessing workflows for:
- Spatial Autoregressive (SAR) modeling
- Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)
- Machine learning pipelines (Random Forest, Neural Networks)
- Student clustering via K-means
- Feature engineering and imputation

The data structure reflects anonymized classroom and student-level variables including spatial coordinates, digital literacy scores, and well-being indicators.
